# Setup

All of this is required BEFORE doing anything else.
Some of Vim's plugins require the tools here
to compile. Without the setup step, you're
left to do it on your own. Good luck.

## Other

- Remove the shit version of vim and link the new one
    sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/vim
    ln -s /usr/bin/vim.gnome /usr/local/bin/vim

- Symlink git-prompt to ~/.git-prompt.sh

- Get a background
    cd ~/Pictures
    feh --bg-fill yourPicture.jpg


# Optional
- Change openboxes terminal hotkeys
    - ctrl-z for previous tab
    - ctrl-x for next tab
